# WHO Early AI-supported Response with Social Listening data

The WHO Early AI-supported Response with Social Listening Platform shows real-time information about how people are talking about COVID-19 online, so we can better manage as the infodemic and pandemic evolve.

More information about the initiative and an exploration of the data can be found at [WHOinfodemic.citibeats.com](http://whoinfodemic.citibeats.com/).

More information about the methodology, data and definitions can be found at [WHOinfodemic.citibeats.com/methodology](http://whoinfodemic.citibeats.com/methodology).

The platform is powered by Citibeats, a text analytics platform specialized in social understanding. More information can be on the methodology page, or found at [www.citibeats.com](http://www.citibeats.com/).

## Intended use

Listening to people&#39;s questions and concerns is an important way for health authorities to learn about what matters to communities in response to COVID-19. This social listening platform aims to show real-time information about how people are talking about COVID-19 online, so we can better manage as the COVID-19 infodemic and pandemic evolve.

While the Early AI-supported Response with Social Listening Platform website facilitates ready made visualizations for easy exploration of the data, the aggregated and anonymized data is made available for anyone wishing to integrate the data into their own research, or integrate the data into their existing workflows.

This is available via the public API as well as this GitHub repository.

Any use of the data should use the citation &#39;World Health Organization, Early AI-supported Response with Social Listening&#39;.

We welcome you sharing with us [how you are using the data](http://whoinfodemic.citibeats.com/share-use-case), as well as feedback on how to [improve the platform for your needs](https://whoinfodemic.citibeats.com/feedback).

## Origin of the data

The data has been obtained from public posts related to COVID-19, using the Twitter API and data aggregators of public sources such as forums, message boards, blogs and comments in news. Please keep in mind that this is only a sample of all COVID-19 conversations.

The data is updated each day with new posts.

_NOTE: all data is subject to quality, technical, and ethical requirements before being added to the system._

More information about the data can be read [here](http://whoinfodemic.citibeats.com/methodology).

## How to interpret the data

Since the civic situation is constantly evolving and social needs are wide-ranging, there is a need for real-time data to serve the decisions of key actors. At the same time, this data must be treated carefully, as the data query and categories are subject to change along with the conversation. This repository will be kept up-to-date with revised data, and changes noted here. Note that, as new sources are added to the system, records from earlier dates could change.

Every analysis based on Internet data has to deal with representativity. Not everyone is connected to the Internet, and not everyone shares their opinion.

Further information on the methodology, data and definitions can be read [here](http://whoinfodemic.citibeats.com/methodology.).

CSV columns:

- `id`: code of the country as defined by [ISO 3166-1 alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3#Officially_assigned_code_elements)
- `date`: day in which the raw data was published in YYYY-MM-DD format (UTC timezone)
- `name`: name of the country in English
- `docs-N`: number of documents for the category N on a given day
- `docs-delta-percent-N`: variation of documents (%) for the category N respect the previous day
- `docs-percent-N`: percent of documents in the category N respect all the other categories in that day
- `docs-female-N`: number of documents for the category N on a given day, which are estimated to be from females
- `docs-male-N`: number of documents for the category N on a given day, which are estimated to be from males
- `docs-questions-N`: number of documents for the category N on a given day, which were questions
- `docs-complaints-N`: number of documents for the category N on a given day, which were complaints

NOTE: each row in the CSV corresponds to one day of data for a specific country.
